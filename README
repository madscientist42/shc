The generic shell script "compiler" (Obfuscator) - shc

This is a fork of the code thoughtfully provided by Francisco 
Javier Rosales García at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid
(frosal@fi.upm.es)

It (currently) basically packages up the scripting into a bundle 
within the C code and hands it off to the passed in (as a last 
command line parameter) shell as a script when it's ran.

The fork was preciptated by some compiler directive misuses, combined
with a desire to move it in directions that make it easier to cross-
compile the tool, have it encapsulate the shell scripting language
that it's packaging either from the shebang line or from a 
command line parameter...that sort of things.

To build: 

	cmake .
	make

To test:
	
	make test

To install:

	make install


Installing will place it in /usr/local/bin and the manpage in 
/usr/local/manpages.  Issuing the command (shc) without parameters
will give you help.

Since this is a fork, you should contact me for assistance via the
GitHub issue tracker for the repository (https://github.com/madscientist42/shc)
